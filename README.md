This repo holds the code used in the study of the spread of tension in Networks using Diffusion Equations.

### Abstract: 
In the past decades, the rise of social media platforms such as Facebook Twitter, and others have fundamentally changed the way social interactions happen. Suddenly, information's transmission rate has known an exponential increase. These new ways of connecting have led to the spread of moral outrage at an unseen rate. Protests, riots, and even revolutions are organized online. The availability of data stemming from these events offers an unprecedented chance to model the spread of outrage in a population. We seek to develop a theoretical framework capable of predicting this spread.
